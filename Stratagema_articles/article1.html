  <h1>First Pillar of Stratagem: Orientation</h1>
  <p>Within the expansive Greek pantheon reside numerous deities, including gods, goddesses, titans, titanesses, as well as a myriad of monsters and divine creatures. Each deity holds sway over specific traits or states. A brief, random list of Greek deities includes Hypnos (Sleep), Zelus (Envy), Nike (Victory), Cratos (Violence), Bia (Force), Horae (Seasons), Eunomia (Order), Dikē (Justice), Eirene (Peace), Apate (Deceit), Geras (Old Age), Eros (Love), and Eris (Discord).</p>

  <p>The Greeks personified conditions to facilitate comprehension. Rather than stating that two warring cities reconciled and ceased hostilities, a typical Greek narrative might describe Eirene (Peace) traversing the cities, persuading their inhabitants to make peace.</p>

  <p>Greek mythology can also be interpreted as narratives about human nature. For instance, when the Iliad recounts Odysseus storming the gates of Troy with Athena, the goddess of wisdom and military strategy, by his side, it suggests that Odysseus acted with wisdom and strategic prowess. Exploring how Athena assisted Odysseus allows us to understand the specific wisdom demonstrated and why his strategy was apt for the situation.</p>

  <p>Through the stories of Greek gods and heroes, we can derive a framework for comprehending the world, identifying necessary changes for thriving, and implementing those changes.</p>

  <h2>Formulating a Strategy</h2>
  <p>Developing a strategy for any goal involves structured thinking about the environment and the various stakeholders influencing or influenced within the arena. This article is the first in a series of four, outlining the Greek approach to strategy formulation. While the proposed structure serves as a guide, conducting thorough research and creating personalized methods to derive conclusions from evidence remains essential. Following this structured approach will pave the way for clear goal achievement.</p>

  <h2>Understanding Stratagem</h2>
  <p>While “stratagem” is sometimes synonymous with military strategy, its primary definition denotes a clever scheme for achieving an objective, often involving the deception of an enemy. While strategy encompasses any plan of action, stratagem typically implies unconventional tactics. Let’s delve into the essence of strategy.</p>

  <h1>Defining Strategy</h1>
  <p>Strategy serves as the path leading from the current state to defined goals. Consider it akin to a map: mark your current location, the destination, and meticulously chart your course. The route may present cliffs, rivers, or obstacles necessitating circumvention. Walking a direct route without consulting the map might lead to falls or wasteful efforts overcoming avoidable obstacles.</p>

  <p>Contrary to a common misconception, strategy isn’t solely a long-term plan; it involves planning the route, while tactics involve execution. A robust strategy remains flexible, ready to adapt to changes. If, for instance, a planned stream crossing becomes unfeasible due to heavy rain, alternatives must be considered.</p>

  <p>Developing a strategy entails understanding the world and discerning the steps needed to reach goals. As the world evolves, a good strategy must be flexible and responsive to change, with the strategist being attuned to altered realities.</p>

  <h1>Forming Your Strategy</h1>
  <p>You can formulate a strategy for various objectives, whether securing a promotion, strengthening familial bonds, or launching a new product. To do so effectively, understand your current state, map the terrain leading to your goals, and commence the journey.</p>

  <h2>The Role of the Strategus</h2>
  <p>The term “strategus” refers to the leader of an endeavor or organization, which also applies to leading oneself. Unlike English terms like General or Chief Executive Officer, the Hebrew word “Matzbee” captures the essence better, signifying a shepherd or guide for an organization.</p>

  <p>Socrates, in his dialogues on the Strategus brought by Xenon, emphasizes that the role is about bringing success and happiness to those led. Socrates suggests that a successful strategist must possess the ability to objectively assess reality, understand possibilities, and recognize necessary changes for progress toward success and happiness.</p>
