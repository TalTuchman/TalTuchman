  <h1>Third Pillar of Stratagema: Systemic inquiry</h1>
  <h2>Chapter 1: Change and Constant</h2>
  <p>After the triumph of the gods, led by Zeus, over the titans under Kronos in the celestial war, Zeus assumed the throne of Olympus with Cratus and Bia, titans embodying violence and brute force.</p>

  <p>While the gods acknowledged Zeus out of fear, he recognized the need for internal change to be accepted as the strategus of Earth and heaven. Zeus, neglecting Cratus and Bia, married Methis and Themis — titan goddesses representing change and constant order, respectively.</p>

  <p>Themis, the titan goddess of constant order, imparts neither advice nor judgment but articulates what is mandatory and possible. Accepting Themis means acknowledging limitations and constraints, epitomizing genuine acceptance by understanding the constraints inherent in any given moment.</p>

  <p>On September 7th, 1822, the French army under Napoleon Bonaparte clashed with the Russian army led by Mikhail Kutuzov in Borodino near Moscow. Despite the French army’s defeat, Kutuzov, a brilliant military strategist, astutely chose not to counterattack immediately. He comprehended that sacrificing Moscow temporarily could secure victory later, sparing the Russian army from a costly confrontation.</p>

  <p>Methis pertains to the future’s uncertainties. Grasping Methis and acting accordingly requires developing new perspectives — inner and outer outlooks — to understand the required changes for adaptation to reality and implementing those changes.</p>

  <p>For instance, adapting to a new boss who employs micromanagement tactics requires a thorough change process. The synergy of Methis and Themis constitutes a genuine understanding of reality, encompassing constraints posed by reality and the adaptation needed to formulate a fitting strategy. Zeus, recognizing this, aligned with Methis and Themis to secure his sovereignty.</p>

  <h2>Chapter 2: Systemic Inquiry</h2>
  <p>Consider a scenario where you’ve launched a new product or business, and initial sales and usage differ from expectations. While standard product strategies emphasize measurement, user learning, and iteration, measurements can be influenced and interpreted subjectively.</p>

  <p>To objectively interpret measurements, a systemic inquiry is imperative.</p>

  <p>A systemic inquiry involves analyzing the entire ecosystem surrounding your goal or problem. It entails understanding the various factors influencing the system and your operational capabilities within it. Strategic formation is fundamentally an exercise in understanding the world.</p>

  <p>The ecosystem comprises stakeholders, the physical and economic environment, and multiple goals or campaigns requiring strategy. A good strategy tailored to a specific goal necessitates understanding all aspects of the ecosystem and the campaign.</p>

  <p>This part of strategy formulation aims to gain a comprehensive view of reality, discerning how the ecosystem is influenced by others’ actions, their motivations, and your limitations in influencing the system.</p>

  <p>The chosen systemic inquiry framework dissects five interconnected parts:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Stakeholders:</strong> Identify every stakeholder in your ecosystem, considering their relation, ability to influence the system, and the campaign.</li>
    <li><strong>Motivations:</strong> Understand the motivations, needs, and wants of each participant concerning your goals and their personal goals and values.</li>
    <li><strong>Challenges:</strong> Identify challenges presented by each participant, gauging their opposition and influence.</li>
    <li><strong>Opportunities:</strong> Recognize opportunities presented by each participant, considering their support and influence.</li>
    <li><strong>Connections:</strong> Assess how stakeholders are connected and their potential influence on each other.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Concluding this exercise, you should have a map revealing the five different parts that help understand the world related to your goals.</p>

  <h2>Actionable Recap:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>List different stakeholders influencing or influenced by your strategy.</li>
    <li>Enumerate motivations, challenges, and opportunities presented by each participant.</li>
    <li>Detail the connections participants have with each other.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Extensive research is crucial for a good systemic inquiry.</p>

  <h2>Chapter 3: Orientation — Flow Toward a Settling View of Reality</h2>
  <p>With a mapped ecosystem of stakeholders, it’s time to contemplate how they might influence your campaign — deciding whom to cooperate with and whom to avoid.</p>

  <p>Estimating people’s actions involves asking two key questions:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>What is their motivation?</strong></li>
    <ul>
      <li>Understand their personal values and how their participation aligns with those values.</li>
      <li>Explore their measurements or performance matrices.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><strong>How did they act in similar situations in the past?</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <p>This concludes the second pillar. Now fully oriented in the ecosystem, the focus shifts to strategizing movement within it.</p>
