  <h1>Second Pillar of Stratagema: Embarassamanet</h1>

  <h1>Chapter 1: Movement Between Orientations</h1>
  <p>Having established the groundwork for contemplating stratagem and the essence of strategy in the introduction, let us delve into the process of formulating a strategy.</p>

  <p>The initial phase of strategy formulation is often the most elusive. Strategy is the path leading from your present state to your objectives, which can encompass anything from launching a product or securing employment to fostering better relations with your spouse or rallying neighbors for a neighborhood watch.</p>

  <p>While embarking on a new venture or setting new goals is straightforward, the challenge arises when seeking improvement within existing careers or relationships. Strategy is an iterative and continuous process. When executing your strategy through tactics (the final step after planning), vigilance is crucial for any unforeseen changes that may necessitate revisiting the initial step.</p>

  <p>The first step in forming a strategy pertains to the juncture when your tactics yield outcomes different from your expectations, catching you off guard. This occurs when the real-world results diverge from your understanding of the world. Anticipating a smooth plateau, you suddenly find your legs ascending a hill.</p>

  <p>When a misalignment arises between the expected and actual results of your strategy, a skilled strategist experiences a sense of embarrassment. Embarrassment can manifest suddenly, such as when expecting a promotion and someone else secures the role. Alternatively, it can unfold gradually, with prolonged expectations of a promotion, accompanied by ambiguous signals about its arrival.</p>

  <p>Human tendency often leans towards favoring information confirming desired beliefs while downplaying contrary evidence. This bias can blind us to reality, leaving us unknowingly embarrassed.</p>

  <p>Embarrassment, in the face of reality, signifies a lack of awareness of our location on the map. The initial step in charting a course toward our goals involves scrutinizing our current actions, discerning what works, and what doesn’t. Employ a critical mindset, relying on hard data when available.</p>

  <p>Achieving enlightenment in the practice of forming a strategy is challenging but less so than spiritual awakenings. Initiate by listing your goals and the current steps taken to achieve them. For new goals without current action, outline the intended actions based on existing research and expertise.</p>

  <p>Post goal listing, identify metrics for progress measurement and commence tracking. While crafting effective performance indicators is challenging, when contemplating strategy, the objective is to gain a clear understanding of the world and its influences on your actions. Without delving deeply into measurement setting techniques, strive to include both qualitative and quantitative measures in your progress assessment.</p>

  <p>Be brutally honest in acknowledging discrepancies between perceived and actual reality. Recognizing declining engagement numbers is straightforward, but noticing the inefficiency of a newly implemented organizational structure or the deterioration of rapport with senior management requires acute awareness.</p>

  <p>The objective at this stage is not to draw conclusions or derive actionable insights; those come later as tactics. Your aim is to assess whether your current approach is effective. If it is, continue; if not, proceed to the next pillar: Systemic Inquiry, where you delve deeper into the problem.</p>

  <p>This oscillation between orientations facilitates the transition from a state of insufficient understanding of how actions influence progress toward goals to acknowledging this lack of orientation (embarrassment). This sets the stage for a systemic inquiry into reality, a pivotal actionable step toward formulating a strategy.</p>

  <h2>Actionable Recap:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>List your goal.</li>
    <li>Enumerate the current steps taken toward achieving that goal.</li>
    <li>Establish measurements indicating the effectiveness of your current method in aligning with reality and advancing you toward your goals.</li>
  </ul>

  <h1>Chapter 2: Destroy the Old</h1>
  <p>To gain a new perspective, one must first dismantle the old. The entire essence of the first pillar lies in recognizing that our current worldview may be inaccurate or entirely misguided.</p>

  <p>Only after willingly abandoning our existing mindset — no small feat — can we begin exploring reality as we formulate our new strategy. Ask yourself candidly, using the most accurate measuring tools available, whether you are closer to achieving your goals today than you were one or three months ago. Do your actions yield results propelling you toward success and happiness?</p>

  <p>Destruction, in the strategic context, entails letting go of perceived truths or beliefs that provide comfort. It requires stepping out of your knowledge comfort zone. Humans harbor numerous biases, desiring affirmation that people appreciate us and that our ideas hold value to them. While this may be true at times, when it’s not, our biases can blind us or instill a fear of seeking contrary evidence.</p>
